Let me preface by saying this is more a personal update on my coding journey rather than a technical blog. It goes over how life sometimes presents itself at the most inconvient times and how challenging coding can be.

I started coding academy in November, it's been one challenge after another with Rails being the icing on the cake. I haven't struggled with a project as much as I did with rails but fortunately for me the Learn cohort leads were very patient and will work with you to get you through the material. For that, I am fortunate! 

To stir the pot I also got a letter in the mail, a sealed envelope from my local police force with my name on it. Boy, was I sweating bullets. What did I do? Parking tickets? Henious crimes? Who knew! Opening it revealed they wanted me - to be a cop for my local force. This was from a test I took three years ago, and was not something that was even remotely on my mind! But, it did have me thinking, so for the first time I was debating which direction to pursue. It had me frozen, I didn't code for a week and I was working out daily attempting to go for this police officer position. 

I got in touch with my life coach, who offered that I should meditate on the decision and really spend some time considering where I saw myself in the next 5 years and deciding what really mattered to me. Me being the all-star I attempt to be, wanted to do it both. So I did! I showed up for orientation and was handed a massive packet to fill out and within 10 minutes of reading through it I realized this was not the position for me. They wanted too much, expected perfection and I was instantly turned off.

I reached out to my life coach again, thanked her for her help and got back to coding. Way behind, super stressed but more determined than ever to succeed - especially with the end so near.
