      It's not easy, spending about six years getting a four year degree in business management, but I did it.. eventually. On graduation it felt like things were falling into place finally and this was my final education, I would spend the rest of my life raking in the money left and right. I always dreamed of wearing the suit, having the office, the money, the lifestyle, you name it. In fact, right out of college, I got it. I landed an awesome job, I started at a top firm as a Financial Advisor Associate two months out of college, a highly competitive position I might add. I spent $3000 on 5 suits and boom we were in business. Day one they taught me how to use the phone and log into the computer and then they slapped down a 1,000 page book on a test I needed to pass. The next two months would be me studying eight hours a day and quickly realizing this was not the position for me. I felt caged, a beautiful double-wide cubicle with about three other people my age to talk to. Food was free, benefits, no time limit on breaks and half the time you didn't have to show up to work as you could claim you were "prospecting for new clients" and roll back over in bed. In theory it was a dream come true, but upon failing the initial test I needed to pass the idea sunk in that maybe high end multi-million dollar sales was not for me.

			 Fine, let's try car sales. The money was great, you could make $2,000 on a single sale! I worked 6 days a week for a month and a half before putting in my two weeks notice. WOMP! FAIL! Can't do the hours, being a car salesman is shady and nobody trusts me, oh and my feet hurt. Thanks for the opportunity!

		   I went back to my original job, a hospital position in an Emergency Room where I am a "sec/tech" - a jack of all trades. Vital signals, EKG's, bloodwork, babysitting intoxicated individuals, you name it and I've either seen it or done it. The good, the bad and even the down right ugly. Things were okay when I hid under the guise of "yeah, I just work here a couples times a month" until they started to see me around more often than that. I was met with "wow, you're still here? I thought you had moved on to some real job and we're a hedge fund manager!". Not quite, Debra.

			 Que to my friend's friend getting a job as a software engineer in Boston for six figures. Wait, what? Rick was a music major and lived at home with his parents, what happened? Turns out he low-key went to flatiron coding academy for six months and really put his head down during the program. He went in as a caterpillar and came out as a monarch, spreading his wings and landing a sweet gig in an awesome company within six months of graduating. I was jealous, and perplexed. I would have to work YEARS AND YEARS to even match his salary, and that was with a ton of schooling! I had to visit. 
			 
			 
		I drive to Boston, we talk about it and I'm inspired. He takes me to where he works, there's ping pong tables, food of all sorts, friends chatting, people napping, skateboarding, even a beer keg! I'm amazed, I ask what's the deal and he tells me the industry favors creativity and teamwork so in order to achieve that they structure an environment that fosters such a result. Amazing, there was no such thing as teamwork in sales. No collaboration, no tips or pointers. Any friend you made had one hand on your shoulder and the other sneaking into your pocket. Sharks. He tells me two of his friends are also applying to the coding academy and I fill out an application as well later that day. Shortly after an interview and a letter of acceptance.

		The change of career came from the opportunity it presents. Learning to code teaches you how to build things. If you are a creative person and have the skills then you can build new things that are not in existence yet. This means with enough persistence and motivation you can create anything, which is of massive appeal to me. I want to be original, different and innovative. Not some desk on a third floor with a nametag. I want to put my minor in entrepreneurship to use and build out advanced programs and  some day save the world. Perhaps that's too high of a bar to set, we can lower it to myself being the only person I save and if that's the case then I'm okay with it. That's why I'm here, in Flatiron.
